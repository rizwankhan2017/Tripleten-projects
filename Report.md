This project explores key drivers of restaurant order volume on Zomato India, using a data-driven dashboard built in Tableau. The goal is to identify patterns that influence customer ordering behavior and provide actionable insights for restaurant strategy and platform optimization.



##### **Hypotheses**

Some of the hypotheses I explored include:

\- Cities with more restaurant are likely to have more orders.

\- Certain cuisines will tend to out perform other cuisines.

\- Restaurants with higher ratings and a greater number of reviews tend to receive more orders.

\- Restaurants with fewer menu options are likely to perform better in terms of order volume.

\- Restaurant cost does not significantly affect the number of orders.



##### **Findings $ Insight**

Cities with more restaurants do not always have more orders on Zomato. For example Bangalore, Delhi, and Pune all have similar amounts of restaurants in them, but Bangalore vastly has more orders. Bangalore has 600k orders while Delhi and Pune have 150k and 90k orders respectively.



Certain cuisines do tend to out perform others. Chinese food is the most popular cuisine which far surpasses other cuisines in total order by double.



Restaurants with higher ratings tend to out perform others with lower ratings. Restaurants with more ratings do not always

have more orders. Although the number of restaurants with "Too Few Ratings" outnumber the amount of restaurants with ratings .



A greater number of menu items is associated with higher order volume.



Restaurants with higher prices will have less orders. But no by a significant amount.



##### **Recommendations**

We should prioritize advertising in cities where the number of orders is disproportionately low compared to the number of restaurants â€” specifically Delhi, Pune, and Chennai. Additionally, we can focus on promoting Chinese restaurants and those with larger menus, as they have more orders. Encouraging customers to rate restaurants will also help improve data quality. Currently, there are more restaurants with "Too Few Ratings" than those with substantial review counts.
